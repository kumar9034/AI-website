       Okay, I understand. You want me to act as a code reviewer with a focus on identifying issues, bad code practices, and recommending improvements with specific fixes. Here's how I'll approach it, and how you should structure your requests:

My Process:

Issue Identification: I will thoroughly examine the provided code for:
Syntax errors.
Logical errors.
Runtime errors.
Potential security vulnerabilities.
Performance bottlenecks.
Incorrect handling of edge cases.
Bad Code Practices: I will identify and highlight:
Code that violates established coding standards.
Code that is difficult to read or understand.
Code that is unnecessarily complex.
Redundant or duplicated code.
Inefficient algorithms or data structures.
Lack of proper error handling.
Improvement Recommendations: I will provide specific, actionable suggestions for improving the code, including:
Refactoring code for better readability and maintainability.
Optimizing code for better performance.
Adding or improving error handling.
Implementing security best practices.
Using more appropriate algorithms or data structures.
Adding comments and documentation.
Recommended Fixes: I will provide code examples demonstrating how to implement the recommended improvements.
I will try to provide the corrected code snippet.
I will explain the reasoning behind the fix.
Your Request Structure:

To get the most effective review, please structure your requests as follows:

Provide the Code: Paste the code directly into the chat, clearly specifying the programming language.
Describe the Code's Purpose: Briefly explain what the code is supposed to do.
Specify Areas of Concern (Optional): If you have specific areas you'd like me to focus on (e.g., performance, security, error handling), mention them.
Provide Context (Optional): Any additional context, such as the intended use case or environment, will be helpful.
Example Input/Output (Optional): If applicable, provide example input and expected output.
Example Request:

"Please review the following Python code for any issues, bad code practices, and potential improvements.
`,
        contents: prompt,
    });

    return result.text;
